Tanishque_Agrawal_Resume.pdf in this resume it is detecting every thing the Parser is working well.

but in res3.pdf it is not detecting right name and right email as the regex I am using decting
k  which is first letter of mail id (wrong email which is ref email in resume) it is detecting as it is coming first but original email is starting with p.

resume2.pdf email it is showing is _c@mt.iitr.ac.in but right one is yash_c@mt.iitr.ac.in due to regex I am using right now it requires improvement.
