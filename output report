Tanishque_Agrawal_Resume.pdf- in this resume it is detecting every thing the Parser is working well.

 res3.pdf- it does not detect the correct name and email address this is because the regex I'm using has some limitations
The first letter of the mail id, k is detected as coming first as k comes before p(the incorrect email, which is the reference email in a resume),
but the original email begins with p.Â 

resume2.pdf-The email that is displayed is _c@mt.iitr.ac.in, but the correct one is yash_c@mt.iitr.ac.in. 
            This is due to the regex I am currently using, which requires improvement.

resume.pdf- With this file name, number is showing null as it is not present in this resume, so it is working right with it.
